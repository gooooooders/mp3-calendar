Supplement your boring Google calendar with this musical calendar.

Do your bins get collected every Friday morning? Play "My old man's a dustman" at 9pm every Thursday and again on Friday 6pm to bring them back in. 
Do you mow your lawn every other Sunday? Play "The first cut is the deepest" every 2nd Sunday at 10am. 
Do you go dancing every Tuesday night? Play "Dancing Queen" by ABBA every Tuesday at 6pm. 
Play "Happy Birthday" at 8am every time it's someone's birthday in your family. 
Play the national anthem on your country's special day. 
Play "the last call" at 11am on 11th Nov every year. 

You get the idea.
