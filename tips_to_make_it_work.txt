IT DOESN'T WORK YET so here are the tips I've received from helpful 
internet strangers to help me get the project up and running

************* CRONTAB *************

Use full paths to VLC, to python (/usr/bin/python3), and to the script (DONE but not 
sure if this needs tweaking in relation to the correct user/root/session/environment)

I received the following tip but don't know what to do with it:
"You also might be able to set the PATH for the cronjobs by putting 
something like this above it: PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin "

I received the following tip but don't know how to do it:
"Check the PATH in cron’s shell. Python3 may be in username,"pi"s PATH, 
but possibly not in cron’s PATH"

************* SCRIPT *************

Plays the mp3 successfully when ran from the command line


************* LOGGING *************

Make a log under /var/log/log_name.log (DONE)
chmod log_name.log (664) (DONE)
Add this to the end of your cronjob line > /var/log/goodbye.log 2>&1 (DONE)
Go through your script and place prints through the execution flow (HOW?)
Set it to run every 5 minutes (*/5 * * * *) then check results


************ ENVIRONMENT / SESSION / USER ID etc ****************

Here's a promising tip I don't yet know how to implement:
"It's probably one of the environmentals that gets set properly in your normal 
user session that is not getting properly configured in the cron environment, 
hence the sound playing audibly during your manual invocations while running 
but not being audible via cron (that process is being invoked but the output 
is just misdirected). Edit: it's probably not this exact environmental, 
though it may be, I suspect it's something very close to what's explained here: 
https://bit.ly/35BAI7b

Cont'd:
Reading up a little more on that variable it wouldn't surprise me if that is 
indeed the one you need to set for cron, just make sure the uid of the user 
matches the directory name/#, you can set/export the setting for that 
variable in your cron command like:
0 5 * * * export VARIABLE=whatever /path/to/python3 /path/to/script.py



************* MISC *************

I've tested the sound output with the 'speaker-test -c' command
The mp3 plays successfully when running the script manually from command line
I'm using Raspberry Pi 400 via SSH on Mac Terminal
